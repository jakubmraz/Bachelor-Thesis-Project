I: Oh, there you go. So, yeah, your task is to log in and vote, and kind of maybe think out loud about what you're doing. And just for the record, I'm going to record your activity and the audio, but for the thesis, I'm only going to quote you anonymously. Is that okay?

T: That's fine.

I: Cool.

T: Okay, so I'm clicking on the yellow button that says I can vote. Oh, I did that again. I see. There we go. Okay. I should choose incognito. Why is this important?

I: Okay. Just for this specific test, I need to save a cookie for you so I don't actually use incognito.

T: So I just press here?

I: Yeah.

T: I'll press to log in. Continue, because we don't log in with MitID. Okay, there we go. Enter. I'll wait and start voting. No, this is my first vote. Okay. I want to change. I want to vote for change. I like that. No, it shouldn't. Next. Just vote for the new person. I like Nancy. There we go. Okay, I press submit vote. Okay. Date and time. This is time. This is date. Okay, I guess that's it. So I just press here, finish, and log out.

I: Yeah, and we're going to do the voting simulation tomorrow.

T: Yes, okay. Cool. There we go. I'll just take a moment. I'm successfully logged out. Returning to front page. Okay, there we go. Do you want me to stop the timer?

I: No.

T: Okay.

I: It's not a timer either. It's a recorder. Yeah, so, I mean, was everything clear?

T: Everything... Yeah, I mean, the only thing was that I shouldn't go into inognito, but that's for the test. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that makes sense.

I: There's nothing I can do about that.

T: No, exactly. But, yeah, I think...

I: I mean, full disclosure, you've seen this part before, right?

T: Yeah.

I: So I think we'll get most of the things that I actually want to ask tomorrow when you do the revoting because you haven't seen that.

T: Mm-hmm.

I: And, yeah, so anything you want to add or, like, anything that surprised you, anything you need to explain?

T: No, I don't think so.

I: Okay, cool.

T: I don't think there's anything I needed to explain either.

I: Right, so... Maybe tomorrow when we have the re-voting, there will be more.

T: Yeah, I think that will be much better.
