1. Voter Registration and Login
- Description: Voter registers and obtains public credentials along with an initial ballot (registration ballot), which contains a “null vote.”  
- Frontend Goal: Guide users through the registration process, ensuring they understand what credentials are being generated and their purpose.
- Edge Case: Voter may be coerced at registration but can still proceed without lying, as the initial ballot is a null vote.
- Notes from Moodboard: Possibly use symbols to simplify the process for the user, as shown in the Swiss implementation.

2. Normal Voting (Without Coercion)
- Description: Voter casts a ballot by providing their vote along with an encrypted list of index references from their previous voting history.  
- Frontend Goal: Simple and intuitive selection menu with optional guidelines. The normal user should not be inconvenienced by the additional safety features.
- Edge Case: Errors in index recall could lead to rejection or noise ballot generation.
- Notes from Moodboard: Swiss implementation felt more robust.

3. Coerced Voting with Deniable Revoting
- Description: Voter submits a coerced vote, followed by a deniable vote that cancels the coerced one.  
- Frontend Goal: If a voter wants to update their vote after coercion, the system should allow them to do so without raising suspicion. 
- Counter-Strategy: Voter intentionally misidentifies their previous ballot indexes, prompting the Voting Server to add noise ballots that obfuscate the coerced vote.

4. Flexible Vote Updating
- Description: Voter can update their vote at any time, even at the last minute, without revealing which vote is legitimate.  
- Frontend Goal: Ensure the UI supports multiple voting sessions while showing only the current valid vote.
- Key Mechanism: Noise ballots ensure that the voting pattern remains hidden.

5. Vote Verification
- Description: Voter checks that their vote appears on the bulletin board as intended.  
- Frontend Goal: Voter can check that their vote has been recorded on the bulletin board without revealing its content. 
- Edge Case: Discrepancies between what was cast and what is seen on the bulletin board.

6. Browser History and Security Management
- Description: Voter is guided on clearing browser history to maintain secrecy and security after voting.  
- Frontend Goal: Provide voters with instructions on clearing browser history and maintaining secrecy after voting.
- Edge Case: Incomplete browser history clearing could expose a voter to coercion.
