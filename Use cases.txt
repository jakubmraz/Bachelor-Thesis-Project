1. Voter Registration
- Description: Voter registers and obtains public credentials along with an initial ballot (registration ballot), which contains a “null vote.”  
- Actors: Voter, Registration Authority  
- Goal: Ensure a voter’s identity and initial credentials are recorded in the append-only bulletin board.  
- Edge Case: Voter may be coerced at registration but can still proceed without lying, as the initial ballot is a null vote.

2. Normal Voting (Without Coercion)
- Description: Voter casts a ballot by providing their vote along with an encrypted list of index references from their previous voting history.  
- Actors: Voter, Voting Server  
- Goal: Submit a legitimate vote and have it added to the voter’s Cast Ballot Record (CBR).  
- Edge Case: Errors in index recall could lead to rejection or noise ballot generation.

3. Coerced Voting with Deniable Revoting
- Description: Voter submits a coerced vote, followed by a deniable vote that cancels the coerced one.  
- Actors: Voter, Voting Server  
- Goal: Prevent the coercer from determining whether the coerced vote was followed.  
- Counter-Strategy: Voter intentionally misidentifies their previous ballot indexes, prompting the Voting Server to add noise ballots that obfuscate the coerced vote.

4. Flexible Vote Updating
- Description: Voter can update their vote at any time, even at the last minute, without revealing which vote is legitimate.  
- Actors: Voter, Voting Server  
- Goal: Allow voters to revise their vote to reflect their true intent, maintaining coercion resistance.  
- Key Mechanism: Noise ballots ensure that the voting pattern remains hidden.

5. Vote Verification
- Description: Voter checks that their vote appears on the bulletin board as intended.  
- Actors: Voter, Bulletin Board  
- Goal: Verify vote inclusion and integrity without revealing vote content.  
- Edge Case: Discrepancies between what was cast and what is seen on the bulletin board.

6. Browser History and Security Management
- Description: Voter is guided on clearing browser history to maintain secrecy and security after voting.  
- Actors: Voter, Frontend Interface  
- Goal: Prevent evidence of voting from being discovered by a coercer.  
- Edge Case: Incomplete browser history clearing could expose a voter to coercion.
